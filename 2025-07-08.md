## Trello Board Creation
- Imposible to add automations through the api
- The WA Cert information might be unrealistic to do automatically
- Annexe my be should be posible
- Adding the quote terms depends on how thats implememnted on hub spot
- Issues caused BCS and the post final spec
- Probably going to set up some notification system for when we create a board so people know they can act on what ever manual task needs to be done

## Hubspot Spec Terms
Cant allow people to use SKUs as terms on the spec sheet (means we cant get the terms from hubspot api as easily)
