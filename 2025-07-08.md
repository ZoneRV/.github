## Trello Board Creation
- Imposible to add automations through the api
- The WA Cert information might be unrealistic to do automatically
- Annexe my be should be posible
- Adding the quote terms depends on how thats implememnted on hub spot
- Issues caused BCS and the post final spec
- Probably going to set up some notification system for when we create a board so people know they can act on what ever manual task needs to be done

## Hubspot Spec Terms
Cant allow people to use SKUs as terms on the spec sheet (means we cant get the terms from hubspot api as easily)

## API & App Logging 
- Trying to decide on a logging system for both bryce and I
  - Already have Seq setup but its $790 USD / year
  - Axiom looks good but requireds more setup and is $300 ish / year
  - Graphana is Free but requires alot of setup / Couple of docker containers
