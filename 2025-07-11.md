## Follow Up From Last Session
- [ ] Item Weights

- [x] Finish off Trello board creation
- [ ] Implement display order on line items

## Trello Board Creation
- Only things we havent done are:
  - Adding terms to the "ATTENTION" card 
  - Automations
  - Creating the WA Cert (we do delete the card if not needed)

But we are creating a comment tagging Lexie when she needs to perform these actions (except the terms).

We are also populating/deleting the card for the annex when needed. 

All this still needs to be retested before running through it again with Lexie.
